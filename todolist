Your project should implement at least the following functionality:
•	User registration, login and logout.
•	View some content (e.g. blog articles, listings, photos, issues, publications).
•	Create new content (e.g. post new blog article, post new listing, upload new photo, create new issue).

Your project should keep its data in a database or in a backend service:
•	Use at least 2 tables (collections) with a relationship, e.g. users and blog posts.
•	Use a database (like MySQL or MongoDB) or cloud-based backend (like Kinvey, MongoLab or RedisLab).
Your project should implement at least 4 pages (views).

Requirements for the Team Projects
Larger teams should develop larger projects. The minimum number of application pages and database tables required for the project
depend on the count of team members.
•	Minimum (3 + team_members_count) pages (views).
•	Minimum team_members_count database tables (or data collections / entities).
•	Implement user registration, login, view content, create content.
•	Implement more functionality by choice. Larger teams should implement more functionality.


Commit Logs
•	Each team member should have at least 5 commits (changes) in the project repository.
•	Please commit every day during the project development to demonstrate your work progress.
•	More commits (especially in more than the last 1-2 days) are better during the project assessment.


Public Project Defense
Each team will have to deliver a public defense of its work in front of the SoftUni trainers.

The teams will have only ~15 minutes for the following:
•	Demonstrate the application’s functionality (very shortly).
•	Show the source code and explain briefly how it works.
At least one team member should come at the defense.

Hints for better presentation:
•	Be well prepared for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time.
•	Open all project assets beforehand to save time: open your site in the browser, login and open the user / admin panel in another browser, open your GitHub project page to show the commit logs, etc.
•	Test how to connect your laptop with the multimedia projector before the defense to save time.
